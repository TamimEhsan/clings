# Clings

Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing C code. Cling is inspired and forked from [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

Visit the **website** for a demo, info about setup and more: ➡️ [Clings](https://tamimehsan.github.io/clings/) ⬅️

## Quick Start
You can install Clings using Cargo (the Rust package manager). Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can get them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). (Yes, it requires Rust to run, but the exercises are all in C!)

```shell
# Installation
cargo install clings
# Initialization
clings init
# Moving into new directory
cd clings
# Starting Clings
clings
```

## Installation from other sources
Pre compiled binaries for various platforms will be made available on the releases page soon. You can also build from source by cloning the repository and running `cargo build --release`.

## Migration
> [!NOTE]
> The migration of websites, documentation and codebase is an ongoing process. All kinds of contributions are welcome. In the meantime the main engine will remain in rust.
