# Clings

Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing C code. Cling is inspired and forked from [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

Visit the **website** for a demo, info about setup and more: ➡️ [Clings](https://tamimehsan.github.io/clings/) ⬅️

> [!NOTE]
> The migration of websites, documentation and codebase is an ongoing process. All kinds of contributions are welcome. In the meantime the main engine will remain in rust.
