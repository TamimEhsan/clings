# Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. In C, the most common types of loops are `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## For Loop
The `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. The syntax is as follows:
```c
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

## While Loop
The `while` loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax is as follows:
```c
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

## Do-While Loop
The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, except that it guarantees to execute the block of code at least once. The syntax is as follows:
```c
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
